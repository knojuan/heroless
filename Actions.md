# Actions
## Defensive

### Brace
*1 AP | Requires Heavy Armor Equipped*

You hold your ground, shifting your stance and tightening behind your armor to absorb the force of an incoming blow. It’s not about speed—it’s about resolve. You may not avoid the hit, but you’re prepared to take it head-on.

[[Skills#Heavy Armor]]
- Declare before an incoming attack roll.  
- If the attack hits and would cause a wound:  
	- Reduce wound severity by **1 + Heavy Armor skill level**.  
- **Does not prevent armor durability loss**.  
- Must be **stationary** to use this action.

---
### Deflect
*1 AP | Requires Armor Equipped*

Instead of absorbing the full brunt of the attack, you shift your posture to let the blow glance off your armor. It’s a practiced maneuver—not one of brute resistance, but of angles and timing—meant to preserve the gear that might save your life in the next exchange.

[[Skills#Heavy Armor]], [[Skills#Light Armor]]
- Declare before an incoming attack roll.  
- If the attack hits and would cause your armor to lose durability, compare the attacker’s roll to your **Deflect DC**:
	- **Deflect DC = 8 + your armor skill modifier** (Light or Heavy Armor)
	- If the attacker’s roll is **less than the DC**, your armor takes **no durability damage**.
	- If the roll is **equal to or higher**, armor loses durability as normal.

---
### Evade
*1 AP*

With a quick read of your opponent’s movement, you attempt to slip aside at just the right moment. It’s not about blocking the strike—it’s about not being where the weapon lands. A risky gamble, but sometimes agility is your only shield.

[[Skills#Agility]]
- Declare before an incoming attack roll.  
- The attacker’s roll is reduced by **1 + Agility skill level**.  
- If the modified result causes the attack to miss, no wound or armor damage occurs.  
- Can only be used once per round.  
- May not be used if **immobilized** or if you did not move this round.

## Offensive

### Attack
*1 AP | Requires Weapon Equipped*

- Roll **2d6**.  
- Add your **weapon skill bonus** and the weapon’s **Roll Modifier**.  
- Compare the final result to the **Attack Resolution Table**.  
- If the result indicates a wound:
	- Apply the weapon’s **Wound Modifier** to adjust the wound level.
	- Apply **armor wound reduction** (if any).
	- Apply the final wound level to the target.
	- Armor loses **1 durability** if it reduced the wound by any amount.

> The Basic Attack is the most common offensive action, representing a standard strike with any weapon.  
> Advanced techniques or weapon effects may alter this action or its outcome.

### Shadow Strike  
*2 AP | Requires Ranged Attack, Must be Hidden*

From the shroud of foliage, shadows, or smoke, the attacker looses a projectile with deadly intent. The shot is swift and sudden, offering no clear origin point. Enemies reel from the impact, but can only guess where it came from.

[[Skills#Stealth]]
- Attack as normal using a ranged attack while hidden
- On a hit
	- Roll 2d6 and add the **Stealth** skill modifier
	- The **DC** is determined by the GM based on difficulty
	- On success, attack is made without revealing your exact location
		- Target knows the general direction of the attack
		- Others must roll Search against your Stealth roll to pinpoint your location

---
### Sundering Strike
*2 AP | Requires Blunt or Slashing Weapon*

You target the armor, not the body—hammering, prying, or tearing with the intent to compromise protection. Whether by raw force or precise leverage, your goal is to leave your opponent exposed and vulnerable, even if they walk away unharmed—this time.

- Attack as normal.  
- On a hit:  
	- **Blunt weapon:** Armor loses durability = wound level  
	- **Slashing weapon:** Armor loses durability = ½ wound level (round up)  
- Target suffers **no wounds** from this attack.  
- Has no effect on unarmored targets.

## Utility

### Assist
*1 AP | Requires Proximity*

You lend your attention, effort, or expertise to support another character's action. Assisting can mean helping lift a barrier, providing light, holding a tool, or offering verbal guidance.

- Declare your intent to assist before the primary character makes their roll.
- You must be within reach or have the means to meaningfully contribute.
- If the GM deems the help appropriate, the assisted character gains **+your relevant skill level**
- Only one Assist may apply to a given action.

---
### Jump  
*1 AP | Basic Movement*

A sudden burst of movement, the Jump action is used to leap across gaps, ascend to higher ground, or avoid obstacles. Its success depends on momentum, distance, and the character’s physical aptitude.

[[Skills#Athletics]]
- Roll 2d6 and add the **Athletics** skill modifier
- The **DC** is determined by the GM based on distance and difficulty

*Situational Modifiers*
- Running start (+1 to the roll)
- Heavy armor (–1 to the roll)

---
### Move
*1 AP | Basic Movement*

You move carefully through your surroundings, staying alert to danger and maintaining awareness. This covers tactical movement, navigation during exploration, or repositioning in combat without haste.

- Move a number of spaces up to your **base movement speed** (default is 3 spaces).
- Applies to all forms of unimpeded movement, including swimming and flying when applicable to your character.

---
### Move Undetected  
*1 AP | Requires concealment, cover, or darkness*

You move stealthily through your surroundings without drawing attention. When successful, the character may reposition while remaining hidden from enemies.

[[Skills#Stealth]]
- Roll 2d6 and add the **Stealth** skill modifier
- The **DC** is determined by the GM based on distance and difficulty

*Situational Modifiers*
- Heavy armor or noisy gear: –2
- Moving slowly (half speed): +1

---
### Search
*1 AP | Requires Line of Sight*

You take a focused moment to examine your surroundings. Whether you're checking for traps, identifying a hidden object, or assessing the layout of a room, Search allows you to turn attention into information.

- Choose a visible object, area, or feature within close range (adjacent or same room/zone).
- Make a Search check using an appropriate skill (e.g., Awareness, Lore, Crafting).
- The GM compares your result to the hidden or required DC and reveals any relevant information.
- May not reveal all details at once—multiple checks may be required for complex features.

---
### Sprint
*2 AP | Extended Movement*

You push your body beyond normal pacing, covering more ground at the expense of attention and combat readiness. Sprinting is faster but riskier.

[[Skills#Athletics]]
- Move **2x your base movement speed** plus your **Athletic skill modifier**.

---
### Hide
*1 AP | Requires Cover*

You duck into shadows, behind obstacles, or into the landscape, using the terrain to break line of sight. Hiding is not invisibility—it’s about exploiting the moment.

- Must be adjacent to or within an area that provides **sufficient concealment**.
- Make a Hide check using your **Stealth skill**.
- Observers must beat your result with a relevant **Perception or Awareness check** to detect you.
- Being spotted or taking an action (other than movement between cover) ends the hidden state.

*Situational Modifiers*
- Heavy armor (–1 to the roll)

---
### Use
*1 AP | Requires Item or Feature*

You interact directly with an item, device, mechanism, or environmental feature. This can include everything from opening a door to lighting a torch to activating a strange device.

- The GM determines whether the use is immediate, contested, or part of a larger sequence.
- Simple or obvious items may succeed automatically.
- Complex, locked, or dangerous items may require a skill check (e.g., Mechanics, Dexterity, Crafting).
