# Downtime Allocation System
A Downtime Session (DS) represents the entire period between two play sessions.A Downtime Unit (DU) represents a day within that session. Downtime sessions are typically equal to the number of real days between a session, but this can be adjusted as needed.

The DU requirements provided below are recommendations and assume a 30 DU session. shorter or longer may need to have their requirements modified.

## Learning New Skills
- Skill Progression and Structure:  
    Each skill level requires dedicated DU across multiple DS to acquire. Training can only advance one level per DS, and the total DU requirement must be met over consecutive DS.

|Skill Level|DU Required per DS|Total DS Required|Total DU Required|
|---|---|---|---|
|Novice (+1)|5 DU|1 DS|5 DU|
|Advanced (+3)|10 DU|2 DS|20 DU|
|Master (+5)|10 DU|3 DS|30 DU|

Example: To achieve Master-level Healing (+5), the character must spend 10 DU per DS over 3 consecutive DS (30 total DU).

### Important Note:
- Skills Being Actively Trained:  
    Skills currently being trained do not require additional maintenance DU during the same DS. The time dedicated to training inherently maintains the skill level.

## Maintaining Skills
- Constant DU Cost per DS:  
    Each skill requires a constant DU cost every DS to maintain. If the required DU is not allocated, the skill deteriorates by one level.
    

|Skill Level|DU Cost per DS|
|---|---|
|Novice (+1)|2 DU|
|Advanced (+3)|4 DU|
|Master (+5)|6 DU|

If a skill is not maintained, it drops by one level. To restore it, the player must spend the necessary DU to re-learn that level.

## Example DU Allocation for a Downtime Session (DS)
This example assumes a standard 30 DU DS for a character with several skills and some exhaustion to recover.

- 6 DU: Maintain Master-level Healing (+5).
- 4 DU: Maintain Advanced-level Athletics (+3).
- 2 DU: Maintain Novice-level Navigation (+1).
- 10 DU: Train Survival from Novice (+1) to Advanced (+3).
- 3 DU: Gather herbs and supplies.
- 2 DU: Recover 2 levels of exhaustion.
- 3 DU: Build relationships with local NPCs.

Total: 30 DU allocated across multiple activities.

## GM Guidelines for Managing Downtime

1. Proportional Adjustments:
	- If a DS contains fewer or more than 30 DU, adjust all skill and maintenance requirements proportionally.
2. Skill Deterioration:
	- Encourage players to prioritize skill maintenance. Failure to allocate the required DU results in deterioration, increasing the challenge of future adventures.
3. Balance Between Training and Maintenance:
	- Players must carefully balance training new skills with maintaining existing ones. Overcommitting to one area could leave characters unprepared in others.
4. Encourage Narrative Use of Downtime:
	- Use downtime activities as an opportunity for character development. Social interactions and crafting can enhance role-play while preparing for future challenges.
