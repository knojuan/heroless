In Heroless, all uncertain outcomes are resolved with a simple, unified mechanic: roll 2d6, add relevant modifiers, and compare to a Difficulty Check (DC). This system is used for combat, skill challenges, social encounters, environmental hazards, and more.

## The Core Mechanic: Roll 2d6 vs DC
To attempt any meaningful action:
1. Roll 2d6.
2. Add any applicable skill modifier.
3. Compare the total to the DC of the action.

- If your total is equal to or greater than the DC, the action succeeds.
- If your total is less than the DC, the action fails.

> Example: A character tries to jump across a collapsed bridge. With Athletics +1, they roll a 6 + 1 = 7. If the DC is 9, they fail.

## Modifiers and Skill Use
Characters may apply a relevant skill bonus when attempting actions:

- Untrained: +0
- Novice: +1
- Advanced: +3
- Master (Specialization Only): +5

Only one skill may apply to a roll, chosen by the GM if ambiguous.
Characters may also apply any relevant trait bonuses.

## General Resolution Table

To reflect the spectrum between outright success and failure, Heroless includes degrees:

|Difference from DC|Result|Description|
|---|---|---|
|3 or more below DC|Failure –3|A critical failure. Major setback, additional consequence, or loss.|
|1–2 below DC|Failure|Simple failure. The action doesn’t succeed.|
|Equal to DC|Success|Success. The action works as intended.|
|1–2 above DC|Success +1/+2|Strong success. Extra efficiency, insight, or added benefit.|
|3 or more above DC|Success +3|Exceptional success. May enable new opportunities or chain actions.|

## Attack Resolution Table

| Roll Total | Result           | Wound Level |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| ≤ 5        | Miss             | —           |
| 6–7        | Glancing Blow    | Level 1     |
| 8–9        | Weak Hit         | Level 2     |
| 10–11      | Solid Hit        | Level 3     |
| 12–13      | Strong Hit       | Level 4     |
| 14–15      | Devastating Hit  | Level 5     |
| 16+        | Critical Hit     | Level 6     |

> Wound levels are applied after modifiers from weapon traits and skill bonuses.  
> If the target is armored, apply armor reduction before assigning the final wound.  
> Armor loses 1 durability if it reduces a wound by any amount.

## Setting Difficulty Checks (DCs)
The GM determines the DC using the nature of the task, any environmental factors, and available tools.

|Difficulty|DC|Unskilled (+0)|Novice (+1)|Advanced (+3)|Master (+5)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Trivial|5|83.3%|91.7%|100.0%|100.0%|
|Routine|7|58.3%|72.2%|91.7%|100.0%|
|Challenging|9|27.8%|41.7%|72.2%|91.7%|
|Difficult|11|8.3%|16.7%|41.7%|72.2%|
|Extreme|13|0.0%|2.8%|16.7%|41.7%|
|Near Impossible|15|0.0%|0.0%|2.8%|16.7%|

## Opposed Rolls
When two characters are in direct competition—both trying to achieve the same goal or cancel each other out—use an Opposed Roll:
1. Both parties roll 2d6 + relevant skill modifier.
2. Compare the final totals.
	- The higher roll wins.
	- If the results are tied, the outcome depends on the context (see below).
3. Use the margin of success to determine degree-based effects.

Example: Two characters are grappling. One rolls 10, the other rolls 8. The first character wins with a margin of +2.

### Ties in Opposed Rolls
- In most cases, a tie favors the defender, maintaining the current state.
- If there is no clear defender, or if both characters are initiating an action (e.g., racing to grab the same object), the GM may call for a re-roll or resolve narratively.

### Degrees in Opposed Rolls
The difference between the two rolls determines the degree of success:

|Margin|Result|Interpretation|
|---|---|---|
|0|Tie|Status quo; no shift unless narrative overrides.|
|1–2|Marginal Win|Barely successful. Limited or partial control gained.|
|3+|Clear Victory|Decisive result. Full control, forced repositioning, etc.|

Example: Two thieves race to grab a falling relic. One rolls 12, the other 8. The first not only grabs it but may also gain a chance to escape or threaten the other.

### Opposed Roll Use Cases
- Grappling, wrestling, or restraining
- Contests of perception vs stealth
- Competing for initiative or control in narrative scenes
- Any situation where two characters are actively working against one another

> GM Tip: Opposed rolls are best used for direct contests. If one party is reacting to an environment or passive resistance, a standard DC is usually more appropriate.
