# Character Creation
Every character in Heroless is defined by what they can do. There are no classes or attributes—only skills, traits, and the choices that shape them. The process below walks you through building your character step-by-step, starting with a concept and ending with a ready-to-play adventurer.

## Define a Concept

Before assigning numbers, take a moment to imagine your character. Who are they? What kind of challenges have they faced? Why do they travel?

Think about:
- Their background or previous role (scout, scavenger, caravan guard, exiled noble, etc.)
- How they’ve survived up to this point
- What makes them stand out—cleverness, toughness, charm, experience?

Your concept doesn’t need to be detailed, but it should guide your choices in later steps.

## Choose a Trait
Each character begins with one **origin trait**, chosen during creation. This trait reflects something notable about your background, training, or nature.

You may choose:
**One Minor Trait** for a small, reliable advantage in specific situations,
**or**
**One Major Trait** for a stronger bonus to a skill or core stat, but with a small drawback

Traits provide benefits to certain rolls or capacities and can shape how your character approaches challenges. Choose one that fits your concept and playstyle.

You’ll find a full list of traits and their effects in the [Traits](03_traits.md#Traits) section.

## Choose Your Skills  
*Select what your character is good at—skills define how you interact with the world.*

Choose **two skills at Novice level** and **one skill at Advanced level** to represent your character’s starting talents. These choices reflect your character’s background, training, or lived experience.

- A **Novice skill** means you are trained—you can attempt moderately difficult actions with a fair chance of success.
- An **Advanced skill** means this is your specialty—you are noticeably competent and can reliably succeed at harder tasks.

There are no attributes in Heroless—**skills drive your effectiveness** in all areas of action and survival. Anyone can attempt any action, but skilled characters have a higher chance of success and can handle more difficult challenges.

You do **not** need to spread skills across different categories—choose what fits your character concept. Some players prefer a broad spread, others lean into a single focus.

You’ll find a full list of skills and what they cover in the [Skills](04_skills.md#Skills) section.

## Choose Your Equipment

Beyond your general resource pool, you may choose 3 specific starting items that reflect your character’s background or role. These should be items that:

- You consistently use
- Define your character’s approach
- May not be easily retrieved from Pack Space

Examples: a worn longsword, a set of lockpicks, a climbing harness, a sacred charm, a battered shield.

See Appendix C: Equipment for examples and guidelines on selecting appropriate starting gear.
