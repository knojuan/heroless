# Custom Actions
## Action Components
- AP Cost – How much of the turn it consumes
- Prerequisites (specific equipment or status)
- Relevant Skill(s)
- Test type – DC (Difficulty Check), Roll modifier, or none
- Effect – What happens on success
- Situational Modifiers – additional modifiers based on specific conditions

## Guidelines
Players and GMs can introduce custom actions. Use the following framework for consistency and balance:
1. Define Intent – clearly describe what the action is trying to accomplish.
2. Set AP Cost
	- 1 AP: Basic, universally accessible actions
	- 2 AP: Strong effects, added risk or mobility
3. Assign Difficulty Check (DC)
	1. Base on the intended complexity and impact:
		1. Moderate: DC 9–10 (reliable for Novice+)
		2. Advanced: DC 11–12 (reliable for Advanced)
		3. Complex: DC 13+ (ideal for Advanced or Master)
	2. Use the Difficulty Checks (DCs) and Success Rates table to align expected player capabilities with the action’s challenge.
4. Determine Effect and Degrees
	1. Tie the impact of the action to its AP cost and DC. High cost or high DC actions should have appropriately strong or dramatic effects.
		1. On Success: Main outcome
		2. Degrees of Success: Bonus effects
		3. Degrees of Failure: Complications or penalties
5. List Requirements, if any
	1. Specific equipment (e.g., a shield)
	2. An intended skill level
	3. A precondition (e.g., being adjacent, hidden, or readied)
6. Sanity Check – compare with existing actions to avoid redundancy or imbalance.
