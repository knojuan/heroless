# Custom Actions
## Action Components
- AP Cost – How much of the turn it consumes
- Prerequisites (specific equipment or status)
- Relevant Skill(s)
- Test type – DC (Difficulty Check), Roll modifier, or none
- Effect – What happens on success
- Situational Modifiers – additional modifiers based on specific conditions

## Guidelines
Players and GMs can introduce custom actions. Use the following framework for consistency and balance:
1. Define Intent – clearly describe what the action is trying to accomplish.
2. Set AP Cost
	- 1 AP: Basic, universally accessible actions
	- 2 AP: Strong effects, added risk or mobility
3. Assign Difficulty Check (DC)
	1. Base on the intended complexity and impact:
		1. Moderate: DC 9–10 (reliable for Novice+)
		2. Advanced: DC 11–12 (reliable for Advanced)
		3. Complex: DC 13+ (ideal for Advanced or Master)
	2. Use the Difficulty Checks (DCs) and Success Rates table to align expected player capabilities with the action’s challenge.
4. Determine Effect and Degrees
	1. Tie the impact of the action to its AP cost and DC. High cost or high DC actions should have appropriately strong or dramatic effects.
		1. On Success: Main outcome
		2. Degrees of Success: Bonus effects
		3. Degrees of Failure: Complications or penalties
5. List Requirements, if any
	1. Specific equipment (e.g., a shield)
	2. An intended skill level
	3. A precondition (e.g., being adjacent, hidden, or readied)
6. Sanity Check – compare with existing actions to avoid redundancy or imbalance.

# Custom Traits
Players and GMs are encouraged to create custom traits to reflect unique character concepts. To ensure consistency and balance, use the following tools to evaluate and classify any new trait.

### Determining Trait Impact
To help decide whether a trait is Minor or Major, review the following questions. If you answer yes to three or more, then it is probably a Major trait:
- Does the trait affect multiple types of encounters (e.g., combat and exploration)?
- Does the trait override or bypass existing rules?
- Does the trait significantly alter character survivability or reliability?
- Does it introduce a new mechanical effect or player-facing option?
- Does the trait require ongoing GM attention or special handling?
- Does the trait alter how the character interacts with the world in a consistent or meaningful way?
- Is the trait always active (rather than only triggering in specific or rare conditions)?
- Would the trait meaningfully influence the outcome of a skill check, action, or encounter?

These questions can be used for both enhancements and impairments. For impairments, simply interpret the questions in terms of how severely the trait hinders or restricts the character.

### Trait Structure Guidelines
- Major Traits should include two mechanical effects.
- Minor Traits should include one mechanical effect.
- Traits typically describe physical characteristics and the effects they cause
- Traits should not replicate or replace skills. If the concept fits better as a skill, it should not be a trait.
- Traits may influence rolls, outcomes, narrative opportunities, or character interactions—but they should not grant extra actions or ignore core mechanics unless clearly justified and well-balanced.
- Traits should be a single, cohesive concept (not a bundle of loosely related effects).
- Traits should provide for the mechanical effects while leaving the physical description open to the player.
