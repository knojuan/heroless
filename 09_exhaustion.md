# Exhaustion
Exhaustion represents a characterâ€™s physical and mental deterioration from injury, overexertion, exposure, or magical strain. Unlike wounds, which reflect trauma, exhaustion tracks the depletion of endurance and willpower. It accumulates gradually but imposes escalating penaltiesâ€”and ultimately leads to death if ignored.

This section explains how exhaustion levels work, how they are gained, and how they can be recovered.

## Exhaustion Track
Exhaustion is measured on a six-level track. Each level applies cumulative penalties on top of those from the previous level. Characters can gain exhaustion from various sources:

- Traveling too long without rest
- Attempting multiple healing actions in a day
- Casting Raw magic
- Performing extreme physical feats
- Suffering untreated wounds

|Level|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|Movement halved|
|2|-1 to all skill rolls|
|3|Action Points (AP) halved, rounded down|
|4|Additional -1 to skill rolls (total -2)|
|5|Character becomes unconscious|
|6|Death by exhaustion|

ðŸ’¡ Note: Effects are cumulative. A character at Level 4 suffers halved movement, -2 to skill rolls, and halved AP.

## Gaining Exhaustion
Characters may gain exhaustion from the following:

- Repeated healing attempts: +1 level per extra healing attempt on the same wound in a day
- Casting Raw magic
- Extended travel or combat: GM may apply exhaustion for prolonged exertion without rest
- Harsh environments: Cold, heat, starvation, or thirst may trigger exhaustion levels over time
- Serious untreated wounds: Certain wounds may worsen into fatigue effects if not stabilized

The GM is encouraged to use exhaustion as a narrative pressure tool that reinforces the harshness of the world and encourages rest, planning, and risk awareness.

## Recovery from Exhaustion
Characters may recover one level of exhaustion per full day spent resting in a safe environment with adequate resources.

- Safe environment: No threats, shelter from the elements, time to rest
- Adequate resources: Food, water, minimal medical or survival support

Exhaustion cannot be recovered:

- In combat or dangerous areas
- While suffering active effects from severe wounds
- Without adequate downtime

Recovery is not guaranteed during travel. Players should plan recovery opportunities carefully to avoid cascading exhaustion penalties.
