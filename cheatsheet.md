# Heroless: Player Cheat Sheet (One-Shot Quickstart)

## 🎲 Basics
- **Roll 2d6 + Skill Modifier** to attempt an action.
- **Modifiers** are based on skill level:
  - Untrained: +0
  - Novice: +1
  - Advanced: +3
  - Master: +5

- **Success = Meet or beat Difficulty Check (DC)**
- **DCs** are typically: 7 (easy), 9 (standard), 11+ (hard)

---

## ⚔️ Combat Basics
- **You have 4 AP (Action Points)** each turn.
- Actions cost 1–3 AP depending on complexity.

### 🪓 Attacking
- Roll 2d6 + weapon skill
- Compare result to the [Combat Resolution Table]
  - 7–9: Glancing Blow
  - 10–11: Solid Hit
  - 12–13: Direct Hit
  - 14+: Critical
- Wounds or armor damage are applied based on hit quality and armor type.

### 🛡️ Defending
- Use **Block**, **Dodge**, or **Brace** (if trained and equipped).
- Each has its own DC and effect.

---

## ❤️ Wounds & Healing
- Characters have **Wound Slots** from Level 1 (light) to Level 6 (fatal).
- If wounds exceed slots or you are wounded while **Incapacitated**, **you die**.
- **Stabilize Wound** to stop someone from dying (Medicine vs DC 8)
- **Treat Wound** to reduce wound severity (DC depends on wound level)

### Natural Healing
- Resting for a day heals 1 wound level (not above Level 3).
- **Treat Wound** or magical aid is required to reduce higher wounds.

## 😴 Exhaustion
- Caused by magic use, travel, or overexertion.
- Effects by level:
  - Level 1: –1 to all skill checks
  - Level 2: +1 AP cost to all actions
  - Level 3: Cannot use advanced or magical actions
  - Level 4: Incapacitated

## 🎒 Pack Space (Gear)
- You have a **Pack Space value** (default: 5)
- To retrieve a general item (e.g., rope, torch), roll 2d6 vs current Pack Space
  - On success, you have it.
  - On failure, increase Pack Space by +1 (you’re running out).

---

## 🔁 Turn Order
- At start of combat, roll **2d6 + Agility** for initiative.
- Highest goes first. Resolve ties by player choice or GM.

- **Equipment**: Weapon, armor, and key tools
- **Wound Slots**: Track how injured you are

## 🧠 Tips
- **Declare your action**, roll if needed.
- Ask the GM if unsure—there’s no wrong question.
- Use your **skills and traits** to lean into who your character is.
