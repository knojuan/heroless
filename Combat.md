# Action Economy
Heroless uses a flexible, tactical Action Economy system governed by Action Points (AP). Each character has a limited number of AP per round, which they must spend to perform movement, attacks, defenses, and other actions. This system emphasizes meaningful decision-making and encourages players to plan their turns carefully.

Every round, a character begins with 3 Action Points by default. Some traits or effects may temporarily increase or reduce this value.

The structure allows both players and GMs to improvise and define actions within a consistent framework, using AP cost and Difficulty Checks (DCs) to determine feasibility and risk. Actions have scalable impact based on how well or poorly a character performs, guided by a universal 2d6 resolution mechanic.
