# This system is a WIP

# Introduction to [Heroless](https://github.com/knojuan/heroless)
Heroless is a skill-based tabletop roleplaying game of survival, consequence, and creative problem-solving. There are no levels, no classes, and no stat blocks—just your choices, your gear, and the odds.

Every character is built through skills. Anyone can attempt anything, but those with training succeed more often and with better results. There are no fixed roles or ability scores—just flexible, open-ended progression and a system that rewards smart, deliberate play.

## Key Themes of Heroless:
- Skill-Driven: Characters are defined by what they know and what they’ve trained for. Every skill is usable from the start, but mastery makes the difference.
- Consequence-Focused: The system favors clear outcomes, not binary pass/fail results. Every roll shapes the story—successes, failures, and everything in between.
- Lethal Combat: Fights are fast and dangerous. One good hit can end a battle. Armor breaks, wounds linger, and poor positioning can be fatal.
- Freeform Magic, Real Risk: Magic is powerful and open-ended, but it’s never free. Casters choose the effect, power, and source—but every cast invites exhaustion, injury, or worse.
- Gear and Resource Management: You don’t track every item, but you don’t have everything either. What you have depends on preparation and chance—and what you don’t have may matter most.

## What You’ll Do in the Game

In Heroless, you’ll take on the role of a survivor in a harsh, uncaring world. You’ll:

- Explore the unknown, uncovering dangers and opportunities through risk and discovery.
- Survive brutal encounters, resource scarcity, and environmental hazards with only what you prepared—or what you find.
- Adapt to changing conditions, evolving your strategy, and making hard calls with real consequences.

There are no heroes here—just people doing their best to live another day.
