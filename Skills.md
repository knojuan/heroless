# What Are Skills?
In Heroless, your character is defined entirely by what they can do. Skills are the foundation of every action—from survival in harsh environments to crafting tools, reading ancient languages, or persuading a hostile crowd. There are no classes or attributes in this system—only what your character has learned and how effectively they can apply it.

Any character can attempt any action. However, trained characters succeed more reliably and can push the limits of what’s possible. Skills shape not only the outcome of a roll but the types of strategies available to a character in the world.

## Acquiring and Improving Skills
Characters may develop new skills or improve existing ones during downtime between sessions. Skill advancement represents structured training, applied practice, or guided mentorship, and is tracked using the Downtime Allocation System (see Downtime Allocation System).

Skill levels and their mechanical bonuses:
- Novice: +1
- Advanced: +3
- Master: +5 (applies only to the chosen specialization)

### Requirements for Learning and Advancement
Skill acquisition and improvement require Downtime Units (DU), accumulated across Downtime Sessions (DS):
- Novice (+1): Requires investing 10 DU, spent across at least 1 consecutive DS
- Advanced (+3): Requires investing 20 DU, spent across at least 2 consecutive DS
- Master (+5): Requires investing 30 DU, spent across at least 3 consecutive DS, and a chosen specialization

Note: DU investments are cumulative and improvements must be made sequentially. A character may only gain Mastery in one specialization per skill.

#### Mentorship and Accelerated Learning
At the GM’s discretion, required DU costs may be reduced if the character gains access to a mentor, formal school, or other opportunity that demonstrates sufficient mastery and is actively teaching the skill. These sources of instruction can significantly reduce the time and effort required to learn or improve a skill, depending on the quality of instruction and the character’s commitment.

## Maintaining Skills
Skills degrade if not maintained. This reflects the natural loss of sharpness over time without regular use, study, or rehearsal. Every skill requires a constant upkeep during each Downtime Session:
- Novice: 2 DU per DS
- Advanced: 4 DU per DS
- Master: 6 DU per DS

If a character fails to allocate the required DU during a DS, the skill deteriorates by one level. For example, a neglected Advanced skill drops to Novice. To recover the lost level, the full DU cost of that level must be reinvested.

Maintaining multiple skills becomes increasingly difficult. Players must choose which skills to focus on and accept that some may fade without regular attention.

---
## Specialization and Mastery
When a skill reaches Master, the player may choose a Specialization, representing focused expertise. Specializations narrow the skill’s scope but grant Mastery (+5) within that focus area only. The character will continue to receive a (+3) bonus to the skill in general.

A character may only hold one specialization per skill, and may only reach Master level in that specialization.

## Skills

### Agility
*Balance, reflexes, and precision in motion*

Agility measures a character’s finesse, coordination, and quick reaction time. It governs actions that rely on nimble footwork, careful positioning, or evasive maneuvers. Where Athletics is used for raw exertion and endurance, Agility is used when split-second timing or fine control is critical. Characters with a high Agility skill can avoid danger, reposition fluidly, and execute acrobatic movements with precision.

- Used for actions involving **dodging, tumbling, balancing, or reflexive movement**.
- Associated with **quickness and control**, not sustained effort.
- Common in **combat defense**, **tight navigation**, and **reaction-based challenges**.

**Related Actions:**
[[Actions#Evade]]

---
### Athletics
*Physical power, endurance, and the ability to exert force over time*

Athletics represents a character’s raw physical capability—sprinting across open ground, climbing walls, jumping across gaps, or pushing through exhaustion. Where Agility governs finesse and reactive movement, Athletics is used when brute strength, momentum, or stamina are required. Characters with a high Athletics skill can endure physical strain, move quickly over rough terrain, and overcome obstacles that require force or endurance.

- Used for actions that involve **running, climbing, jumping, lifting, or forcing**.
- Associated with physical exertion, **not** reflexive precision.
- Common in **exploration**, **combat positioning**, and **environmental traversal**.

**Related Actions**:  
[[Actions#Jump]], [[Actions#Sprint]]

### Light Armor 
*Wearing and maneuvering in minimal or flexible protective gear*

Light Armor reflects a character’s ability to move comfortably while wearing minimal armor, such as padded, leather, or layered textile gear. It assumes an emphasis on mobility and agility rather than full protection. Skilled users can maintain full range of motion, avoid noise penalties, and make the most of limited protection without compromising speed.

- Affects use of **padded, leather, or flexible armor types**.
- Emphasizes **mobility, comfort, and stealth compatibility**.

**Related Actions:**
[[Actions#Deflect]]

---
### Heavy Armor
*Endurance, stance, and control while wearing bulky protective gear*

Heavy Armor reflects a character’s training and discipline while encased in full or partial rigid armor, such as mail, plate, or reinforced constructs. It emphasizes endurance, stability, and the ability to operate effectively despite the constraints of weight and bulk. Skilled users can move efficiently, absorb blows, and minimize fatigue or vulnerability due to encumbrance.

- Affects use of **chainmail, scale, plate, and other heavy gear**.
- Emphasizes **protection, stance, and energy conservation**.

**Related Actions:**
[[Actions#Brace]], [[Actions#Deflect]]

---
### Stealth
*Concealment of movement, presence, and intention*

Stealth represents a character’s ability to remain unnoticed by others—through silence, shadow, cover, and timing. It is used to hide, move quietly, evade detection, or position oneself without being seen. Stealth requires awareness of the environment, control of noise and silhouette, and a practiced sense of when to move or remain still. It is not used for hand-based trickery or deception, but for physically avoiding notice.

- Used for actions involving **hiding, sneaking, stalking, and evading detection**.
- Common in **ambushes, infiltration, and escape scenarios**.

**Related Actions:**
[[Actions#Hide]], [[Actions#Move Undetected]], [[Actions#Shadow Strike]]

**Example Actions**:  
- *Hide* — conceal yourself from view using terrain or cover  
- *Move Silently* — cross dangerous or patrolled terrain without drawing attention  
- *Shadow* — follow a person or group without being seen  
- *Set Ambush* — prepare to strike without alerting enemies  
- *Avoid Detection* — remain unseen while under observation
