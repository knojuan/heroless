# What Are Skills?
In Heroless, your character is defined entirely by what they can do. Skills are the foundation of every action—from survival in harsh environments to crafting tools, reading ancient languages, or persuading a hostile crowd. There are no classes or attributes in this system—only what your character has learned and how effectively they can apply it.

Any character can attempt any action. However, trained characters succeed more reliably and can push the limits of what’s possible. Skills shape not only the outcome of a roll but the types of strategies available to a character in the world.

## Acquiring and Improving Skills
Characters may develop new skills or improve existing ones during downtime between sessions. Skill advancement represents structured training, applied practice, or guided mentorship, and is tracked using the Downtime Allocation System (see Downtime Allocation System).

Skill levels and their mechanical bonuses:
- Novice: +1
- Advanced: +3
- Master: +5 (applies only to the chosen specialization)

### Requirements for Learning and Advancement
Skill acquisition and improvement require Downtime Units (DU), accumulated across Downtime Sessions (DS):
- Novice (+1): Requires investing 10 DU, spent across at least 1 consecutive DS
- Advanced (+3): Requires investing 20 DU, spent across at least 2 consecutive DS
- Master (+5): Requires investing 30 DU, spent across at least 3 consecutive DS, and a chosen specialization

Note: DU investments are cumulative and improvements must be made sequentially. A character may only gain Mastery in one specialization per skill.

#### Mentorship and Accelerated Learning
At the GM’s discretion, required DU costs may be reduced if the character gains access to a mentor, formal school, or other opportunity that demonstrates sufficient mastery and is actively teaching the skill. These sources of instruction can significantly reduce the time and effort required to learn or improve a skill, depending on the quality of instruction and the character’s commitment.

## Maintaining Skills
Skills degrade if not maintained. This reflects the natural loss of sharpness over time without regular use, study, or rehearsal. Every skill requires a constant upkeep during each Downtime Session:
- Novice: 2 DU per DS
- Advanced: 4 DU per DS
- Master: 6 DU per DS

If a character fails to allocate the required DU during a DS, the skill deteriorates by one level. For example, a neglected Advanced skill drops to Novice. To recover the lost level, the full DU cost of that level must be reinvested.

Maintaining multiple skills becomes increasingly difficult. Players must choose which skills to focus on and accept that some may fade without regular attention.

---
## Specialization and Mastery
When a skill reaches Master, the player may choose a Specialization, representing focused expertise. Specializations narrow the skill’s scope but grant Mastery (+5) within that focus area only. The character will continue to receive a (+3) bonus to the skill in general.

A character may only hold one specialization per skill, and may only reach Master level in that specialization.
