# Character Creation
Every character in Heroless is defined by what they can do. There are no classes or attributes—only skills, traits, and the choices that shape them. The process below walks you through building your character step-by-step, starting with a concept and ending with a ready-to-play adventurer.

## Concept

Before assigning numbers, take a moment to imagine your character. Who are they? What kind of challenges have they faced? Why do they travel?

Think about:
- Their background or previous role (scout, scavenger, caravan guard, exiled noble, etc.)
- How they’ve survived up to this point
- What makes them stand out—cleverness, toughness, charm, experience?

Your concept doesn’t need to be detailed, but it should guide your choices in later steps.

## Traits

Traits provide enhancements or impairments that influence your character’s physical capabilities. Each trait may offer a minor or major effect and is classified as either an enhancement (advantage) or impairment (disadvantage).

You begin with 2 Character Points (CP) to spend on enhancements.
- You may take impairments to gain additional CP.
- To select a major enhancement (3 CP), you must take at least one impairment.
- For every 1 CP not spent on traits, you gain +1 Skill Point.

Some sample combinations:
- One minor enhancement (1 CP), one minor impairment (–1 CP), saving 2 CP for extra SP
- Two minor enhancements (2 CP), no impairments, no extra SP
- One major enhancement (3 CP), one major impairment (–3 CP), saving 2 CP for extra SP

Trait effects are qualitative rather than numerical but can dramatically change how your character navigates the world. See Appendix A: Traits for a list of predefined traits.

## Skills

Skills are the backbone of the system. All actions—combat, exploration, survival, and interaction—use them. Choose skills that reflect your character’s concept.

You begin with 5 Skill Points (SP), plus any unspent CP from Step 2. Use your Skill Points to acquire your character’s initial skills.

- Novice (+1) costs 1SP
- Advanced (+3) costs 3SP
- Master(+5 in specialty) costs 5SP

Some skills represent general knowledge (Survival, Crafting), while others govern specific actions (Blades, Diplomacy, Navigation).

A complete list of skills with descriptions can be found in Appendix B: Skills.

## Equipment

Beyond your general resource pool, you may choose 3 specific starting items that reflect your character’s background or role. These should be items that:

- You consistently use
- Define your character’s approach
- May not be easily retrieved from Pack Space

Examples: a worn longsword, a set of lockpicks, a climbing harness, a sacred charm, a battered shield.

See Appendix C: Equipment for examples and guidelines on selecting appropriate starting gear.
