# What Are Skills

Skills represent the learned abilities and natural aptitudes your character relies on to act effectively in the world. Every action in *Heroless* is tied to a skill, and your skill levels define what your character is good at—and how good they are at it.

Skills are not abstract stats or attributes. They are practical, applicable areas of competence. Whether you're hunting, healing, deceiving, crafting, or negotiating, your skills shape both what you attempt and how likely you are to succeed.

---
## Skill Levels

Each skill has one of four levels:

- **Untrained** — No bonus. You can attempt basic tasks, but difficulty is higher and results are less reliable.
- **Novice** — +1 bonus. You’ve trained in this area and can perform moderately difficult tasks with consistency.
- **Advanced** — +2 bonus. You are highly skilled and capable of tackling complex or demanding challenges.
- **Master** — +3 bonus. You’re among the best. Mastery offers maximum reliability and impact.

Most characters begin play with **two Novice skills** and **one Advanced skill**. Over time, skills can improve through focused downtime and narrative development.

---
## Using Skills in Play

Most actions in *Heroless* reference a specific skill. When you attempt something meaningful, the GM will determine which skill applies and whether a check is required.

Skilled characters have a higher chance of success and are capable of attempting more difficult or specialized tasks. While any character can try any action, those with relevant skill training will perform more consistently and suffer fewer consequences on failure.

**Example**:  
If you're trying to set an ambush, the GM may call for a *Stealth* check. A character with Stealth at Advanced will have a better chance of surprising the enemy than one who is untrained.

---
## Skill Advancement

Skills improve as a result of effort, training, and experience. Advancement is typically tied to **downtime activities**, not just in-session rolls. A character must spend time practicing, studying, or applying the skill meaningfully in order to improve.

The GM may allow a skill to increase after:
- Repeated use in high-risk situations
- Time spent training with a teacher or mentor
- Focused self-practice during downtime

Skill progression is not automatic and may be limited by in-world access, opportunity, or narrative justification.

## Choosing Skills Wisely

Each skill supports a wide range of related actions. For example:

- *Survival* might include foraging, navigating wilderness, and recognizing hazards.
- *Crafting* could cover repair, construction, and resource conversion.
- *Diplomacy* supports persuasion, intimidation, negotiation, and lying.

Choose skills that match how you envision your character behaving. Do you want to support the group through tactics and scouting? Influence others with charm or pressure? Build, heal, or guide? Your skill choices should reflect your concept.

---
## Skill Limits and Balance

There are no restrictions on which skills you select—any combination is valid. However, skills cannot exceed **Master level**, and very few characters will reach Mastery during early play. Advancement becomes slower over time to encourage broader development rather than immediate specialization.

While you may see characters improve their skills over time, you will rarely see a character become the best at everything. Skill diversity and interdependence are part of the system’s core design.

---
## Final Notes

- Skills are your mechanical foundation. Choose them with intention.
- Traits can enhance specific actions or circumstances, but **skills are the core of your success rate**.
- Advancement takes effort—consider which skills you’re likely to use or grow.
- Trust your teammates. You don’t have to do everything—just do your part well.

## Skills

### Agility
*Balance, reflexes, and precision in motion*

Agility measures a character’s finesse, coordination, and quick reaction time. It governs actions that rely on nimble footwork, careful positioning, or evasive maneuvers. Where Athletics is used for raw exertion and endurance, Agility is used when split-second timing or fine control is critical. Characters with a high Agility skill can avoid danger, reposition fluidly, and execute acrobatic movements with precision.

- Used for actions involving **dodging, tumbling, balancing, or reflexive movement**.
- Associated with **quickness and control**, not sustained effort.
- Common in **combat defense**, **tight navigation**, and **reaction-based challenges**.

**Related Actions:**

### Athletics
*Physical power, endurance, and the ability to exert force over time*

Athletics represents a character’s raw physical capability—sprinting across open ground, climbing walls, jumping across gaps, or pushing through exhaustion. Where Agility governs finesse and reactive movement, Athletics is used when brute strength, momentum, or stamina are required. Characters with a high Athletics skill can endure physical strain, move quickly over rough terrain, and overcome obstacles that require force or endurance.

- Used for actions that involve **running, climbing, jumping, lifting, or forcing**.
- Associated with physical exertion, **not** reflexive precision.
- Common in **exploration**, **combat positioning**, and **environmental traversal**.

- Used for **paralyzing, containing, or suppressing entities or spells**.
- Common in **crowd control, magical duels, or defensive tactics**.

**Related Actions**:

### Destruction (Magic)
*The raw force of unmaking—inflicting damage or collapse*

- Used for **dealing damage or breaking objects and barriers**.
- Common in **combat, sabotage, and tactical offense**.

**Related Actions**:

### Diplomacy
*Influence through speech, tone, and presence*

Diplomacy governs a character’s ability to affect others through verbal and nonverbal communication. It includes persuading, deceiving, negotiating, intimidating, and calming others in social situations. This skill is not about raw charisma but about the practiced application of influence—reading a situation and applying the right pressure or tone to achieve a desired outcome. While some may specialize in deception or intimidation, all social influence begins with Diplomacy.

- Used for actions involving **persuasion, negotiation, intimidation, and deception**.
- Focuses on **influence**, not knowledge or performance.
- Common in **social encounters, faction interactions, and interrogation scenes**.

**Example Actions**:  
- *Persuade* — convince a character to take or avoid a course of action  
- *Intimidate* — coerce compliance through threat, posture, or presence  
- *Deceive* — mislead others through lies, omissions, or redirection

### Heavy Armor
*Endurance, stance, and control while wearing bulky protective gear*

Heavy Armor reflects a character’s training and discipline while encased in full or partial rigid armor, such as mail, plate, or reinforced constructs. It emphasizes endurance, stability, and the ability to operate effectively despite the constraints of weight and bulk. Skilled users can move efficiently, absorb blows, and minimize fatigue or vulnerability due to encumbrance.

- Affects use of **chainmail, scale, plate, and other heavy gear**.
- Emphasizes **protection, stance, and energy conservation**.

### Light Armor 
*Wearing and maneuvering in minimal or flexible protective gear*

Light Armor reflects a character’s ability to move comfortably while wearing minimal armor, such as padded, leather, or layered textile gear. It assumes an emphasis on mobility and agility rather than full protection. Skilled users can maintain full range of motion, avoid noise penalties, and make the most of limited protection without compromising speed.

- Affects use of **padded, leather, or flexible armor types**.
- Emphasizes **mobility, comfort, and stealth compatibility**.

### Manipulation (Magic)
*Command over physical matter—movement, reshaping, or force*

---
### Medicine
*Knowledge and practice of treating injuries, stabilizing wounds, and preventing physical deterioration*

The Medicine skill represents a character’s understanding of the body—how it breaks, how it heals, and what can be done to assist or accelerate recovery. This skill encompasses battlefield first aid, diagnosis of injuries, application of herbal or improvised remedies, and long-term care. It is essential for treating wounded companions, especially in dangerous or resource-limited environments.

Medicine is most effective when paired with the right tools (bandages, splints, antiseptics), but a skilled healer can improvise with what’s on hand. This skill does not allow for magical healing, but may be used alongside it where appropriate.

- Used for actions involving **stabilizing critical wounds, treating injuries, and supporting long-term recovery**.
- Unlike Crafting or Alchemy, this skill focuses on living bodies, not materials or concoctions.
- Common in **aftermath of combat, survival situations, and extended travel**.

[Treat Wound](11_actions.md#Treat-Wound)

### Perception (Magic)
*Expanded awareness and magical sight beyond the mundane*

The Perception skill governs your ability to sense hidden truths—detecting auras, illusions, enchantments, or distant events. This domain enhances knowledge rather than action.

- Used for **detecting magic, illusions, or invisible forces**.
- Common in **exploration, investigation, and arcane analysis**.

**Related Actions**:

- Common in **defense, group support, and countermeasures**.

**Related Actions**:  
[Cast](10_magic.md#Cast)

---
### Resolve
*Mental endurance, emotional control, and disciplined focus*

Resolve represents a character’s inner strength—the ability to resist fear, coercion, despair, and magical influence, as well as to maintain mental control through structured thought and willful discipline. It governs the capacity to stay calm under pressure, follow orders or routines in difficult conditions, and suppress instinctive or emotional reactions. Resolve is not about persuasion or spirituality, but the ability to *not break*, *not falter*, and *not be swayed*—whether resisting manipulation or holding formation through sheer will.

- Used for resisting **fear, influence, instinct, distraction, and emotional disruption**.
- Combines the passive endurance of resilience with the active control of discipline.
- Common in **magical resistance, high-stress situations, rituals, and structured organizations**.

**Related Actions:**
[Intimidate](11_actions.md#Intimidate)

---
### Restoration (Magic)
*The power to heal, purify, and mend what has been damaged*

The Restoration skill governs your ability to restore vitality, close wounds, or purge harmful conditions. While not a cure-all, this domain is often the difference between survival and loss.

- Used for **healing wounds and removing harmful effects**.
- Common in **aftermath of combat, disease, or magical affliction**.

**Related Actions**:  
[Cast](10_magic.md#Cast)

---
### Stealth
*Concealment of movement, presence, and intention*

Stealth represents a character’s ability to remain unnoticed by others—through silence, shadow, cover, and timing. It is used to hide, move quietly, evade detection, or position oneself without being seen. Stealth requires awareness of the environment, control of noise and silhouette, and a practiced sense of when to move or remain still. It is not used for hand-based trickery or deception, but for physically avoiding notice.

- Used for actions involving **hiding, sneaking, stalking, and evading detection**.
- Common in **ambushes, infiltration, and escape scenarios**.

**Related Actions:**
[Hide](11_actions.md#Hide)
[Move Undetected](11_actions.md#Move%20Undetected)

### Summoning (Magic)
*The calling of entities or objects from elsewhere*

The Summoning skill governs your ability to bring creatures, objects, or spirits into the current plane. These manifestations may be brief, autonomous, or persistent depending on the effort and intent.

- Used for **calling allies, creating tools, or populating the field**.
- Common in **support, battlefield control, and exploration utility**.
