# What Are Traits
Traits represent unique characteristics that define a character's background, quirks, strengths, or adaptations. Unlike skills, which affect a wide range of actions, traits offer **narrow, situational advantages** or impactful tradeoffs that help shape your playstyle and identity.

All traits provide mechanical effects, and most are tied directly to skill checks, action types, or character limits such as AP, Wound Slots, or Inventory Slots. Every character begins with one **origin trait** that reflects their nature, training, or past experiences.

## Types of Traits

There are two types of traits in Heroless, each with a distinct role in shaping gameplay:

### Minor Traits

- Provide a **+1 bonus** to a specific **action** or **limited circumstance**
- Have **no drawbacks**
- Safe, subtle, and useful in specific scenarios

### Major Traits

- Provide a **+1 bonus** to a **skill** or to a **core stat** (AP, Wound Slot, or Inventory Slot)
- Come with a **-1 penalty** to a specific **action**, **circumstance**, or **skill**
- Offer greater power, but introduce a meaningful tradeoff

This structure allows players to choose between a **low-risk minor benefit** or a **stronger major benefit** with a cost.

---
## Gaining Traits

Each character begins play with one **origin trait**, either Minor or Major. This trait should reflect the character’s upbringing, training, or innate tendencies.

In some campaigns, characters may gain additional traits through **story-driven progression**, such as:

- Unique milestones
- Surviving major events
- Receiving specialized training

These additional traits are **earned** through roleplay and narrative development, not chosen freely. A character should gain **no more than 1–2 additional traits** during their lifetime to preserve balance.

## Using Traits in Play

Trait effects apply automatically when relevant. If a character has a trait that adds +1 to a specific type of action or check, they gain that bonus whenever the GM rules the trait applies. Likewise, any drawbacks associated with a major trait are always in effect when relevant.

Players are encouraged to bring up their traits during relevant moments. GMs should consider traits when setting difficulty or narrating success and failure.

# Traits

## Minor

### Keen Nose
Your sense of smell is unusually sharp, allowing you to detect subtle odors that others would miss—whether it's spoiled food, nearby predators, or trace scents in the air.

- +1 to checks involving scent-based detection

---
### Sure-Footed
You’ve trained your body to stay balanced even on shifting stones, crumbling ruins, or slick ground. Where others hesitate, you move confidently.

- +1 to Traverse Hazardous Terrain checks

---
### Quick Reflexes
You react instinctively to danger and opportunity alike, often acting before others have fully registered the situation.

- +1 to Initiative rolls

---
### Night-Tuned
You’ve spent enough time in darkness that your senses adapt quickly, allowing you to operate effectively in conditions that hinder others.

- +1 to checks made in dim or low light

---
### Pack-Savvy
Years of experience packing and repacking gear have made you exceptionally efficient. You can find what you need quickly, even under pressure.

- +1 to Pack Space checks

---
## Major

### Battle-Hardened
You've faced fear, pain, and death—and come out stronger. Your resolve is unshakable, but your grim demeanor can alienate others.

- +1 to Resolve skill
- -1 to Diplomacy checks

---
### Fast Mover
You move with speed and urgency, always a step ahead. While quick on your feet, your attacks lack force and precision.

- +1 Action Point (AP)
- -2 to all martial attacks

---
### Deadeye
You have a natural talent for precision at long distances. Your shots are steady and true, but you’re far less comfortable in close combat.

- +1 to Ranged Attack rolls
- -1 to Melee Attack rolls

---
### Pack Mule
You’ve built your body for burden over speed—capable of hauling gear others would leave behind, but at the cost of nimbleness.

- +1 Inventory Slot
- -1 to Agility skill

---
### Unyielding
Your body endures beyond normal limits. You push through pain and punishment that would leave others unconscious—but your wounds close slowly, and recovery is hard-won.

- +1 Wound Slot
- -1 to all rolls for healing received
