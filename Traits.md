# Rework ToDos
one **origin trait** per character, with the choice between a **minor enhancement** or a **major enhancement plus minor impairment**

To keep your system elegant **while still allowing flexibility**, consider the following additions:

1. **Optional Rule Sidebar – Expanded Traits**  
    Include a sidebar like this in the rulebook:
    
    > **Optional Rule: Expanded Trait Paths**  
    > Some campaigns may allow characters to gain additional traits over time as part of character growth, special training, or story milestones. These must be earned through roleplay, not purchased with points, and should be limited to 1-2 additions over a character's lifetime to maintain balance.
    
2. **Trait Advancement Hooks**  
    You can leave the door open narratively, by suggesting:
    
    > "While origin traits define your foundational background, it's possible to develop new traits through exceptional story events—such as mystical transformations, rare training, or cosmic bargains."

# What Are Traits?
Traits represent inherent or developed characteristics that define a character's physical form or biological capabilities. Unlike skills, which can be trained and improved over time, traits are typically permanent and reflect the unique qualities, strengths, or limitations of a character. They may be physical mutations, environmental adaptations, injuries, social markers, or other narrative elements with mechanical impact.

Traits add mechanical and narrative flavor and are categorized by type:
- Enhancement – Grants a beneficial effect.
- Impairment – Introduces a drawback or vulnerability.

Each type is also classified by impact:
- Major – Significant, multi-encounter effects.
- Minor – Limited or situational effects.

## Acquiring Traits
### Character Points (CP) - 
Traits are acquired by spending or gaining Character Points (CP) during character creation:
- Enhancements cost CP. Minor enhancements cost 1 CP, major enhancements cost 3 CP.
- Impairments grant CP. Minor impairments grant 1 CP, major impairments grant 3 CP.

There is no limit to the number of traits a character may take, as long as the total CP remains balanced. Players may choose multiple enhancements by offsetting them with impairments, or they may take only one or two traits and conserve CP for other uses.

Unused CP can be converted into Skill Points (SP) at a 1:1 ratio, allowing for flexible character development.

Traits are generally permanent and not gained during play. However, at the GM’s discretion, traits may be added or removed based on major narrative events such as curses, injuries, transformations, or long-term adaptation.

## Trait Creation Tools
Players and GMs are encouraged to create custom traits to reflect unique character concepts. To ensure consistency and balance, use the following tools to evaluate and classify any new trait.

### Determining Trait Impact
To help decide whether a trait is Minor or Major, review the following questions. If you answer yes to three or more, then it is probably a Major trait:
- Does the trait affect multiple types of encounters (e.g., combat and exploration)?
- Does the trait override or bypass existing rules?
- Does the trait significantly alter character survivability or reliability?
- Does it introduce a new mechanical effect or player-facing option?
- Does the trait require ongoing GM attention or special handling?
- Does the trait alter how the character interacts with the world in a consistent or meaningful way?
- Is the trait always active (rather than only triggering in specific or rare conditions)?
- Would the trait meaningfully influence the outcome of a skill check, action, or encounter?

These questions can be used for both enhancements and impairments. For impairments, simply interpret the questions in terms of how severely the trait hinders or restricts the character.

### Trait Structure Guidelines
- Major Traits should include two mechanical effects.
- Minor Traits should include one mechanical effect.
- Traits typically describe physical characteristics and the effects they cause
- Traits should not replicate or replace skills. If the concept fits better as a skill, it should not be a trait.
- Traits may influence rolls, outcomes, narrative opportunities, or character interactions—but they should not grant extra actions or ignore core mechanics unless clearly justified and well-balanced.
- Traits should be a single, cohesive concept (not a bundle of loosely related effects).
- Traits should provide for the mechanical effects while leaving the physical description open to the player.
