# Action Economy
Heroless uses a flexible, tactical Action Economy system governed by Action Points (AP). Each character has a limited number of AP per round, which they must spend to perform movement, attacks, defenses, and other actions. This system emphasizes meaningful decision-making and encourages players to plan their turns carefully.

Every round, a character begins with 5 Action Points by default. Some traits or effects may temporarily increase or reduce this value.

The structure allows both players and GMs to improvise and define actions within a consistent framework, using AP cost and Difficulty Checks (DCs) to determine feasibility and risk. Actions have scalable impact based on how well or poorly a character performs, guided by a universal 2d6 resolution mechanic.

## Action Points (AP)
- Base AP per Round: 3
- AP Refresh: Fully replenished at the start of each round
- Unused AP: Does not carry over between rounds
- Additional Costs: Effects like armor weight or exhaustion may reduce available AP; certain abilities may increase it

---
## Action Components
- AP Cost – How much of the turn it consumes
- DC (Difficulty Check) – If a roll is needed, this determines success or failure
- Effect – What happens on success
- Degree Effects – Additional outcomes based on how well or poorly the roll goes

## Action Complexity and AP Cost
The AP cost of an action reflects its complexity and battlefield impact:

| Complexity | Examples | AP Cost | Guidelines |
|---|---|---|---|
|Simple|Basic Attack, Guard|1 AP|Standard actions available to all characters, minimal mechanics|
|Moderate|Charge, Dodge, Grapple|2 AP|Adds movement, special effects, or conditions|
|Complex|Decisive Blow, Armor Shatter|3+ AP|High impact, battlefield-altering or multi-target effects|

Modifiers that Increase AP Cost:
- Combines movement and attack (+1 AP)
- Affects multiple targets or a large area (+1 AP)
- Uses a rare or restricted trait, magic, or preparation

## Difficulty Checks (DCs) and Success Rates
Most actions require a skill check:  
2d6 + Skill Bonus ≥ DC

Use this chart to align expected success rates with skill level and intended difficulty:

|Skill Level|Easy (80%+)|Moderate (60–70%)|Challenging (40–50%)|Difficult (<30%)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Unskilled (+0)|DC 5|DC 7|DC 9|DC 11|
|Novice (+1)|DC 6|DC 8|DC 10|DC 12|
|Advanced (+3)|DC 8|DC 10|DC 12|DC 14|
|Master (+5)|DC 10|DC 12|DC 14|DC 16|

GMs and players should assign higher DCs to complex or powerful actions, especially those that alter the flow of combat or affect multiple entities.

---
## Degree of Success or Failure
Every roll produces not just a binary success/failure, but a degree of outcome:
- Success: Roll ≥ DC
- Degree Success: Roll ≥ DC + 3 → Bonus effect
- Failure: Roll < DC
- Degree Failure: Roll ≤ DC - 3 → Complication

|Degree|Effect Example|Usage|
|---|---|---|
|±2|Minor bonus or penalty (e.g., AP refund/loss, +1/-1 future roll)|Simple actions or low-stakes situations|
|±3|Moderate bonus or penalty (e.g., knockback, minor wound, AP drain)|Standard for most combat actions|
|±4 or more|Major bonus or penalty (e.g., break armor, inflict lasting wound)|High-risk actions or critical results|

## Creating New Actions
Players and GMs can introduce custom actions. Use the following framework for consistency and balance:
1. Define Intent – clearly describe what the action is trying to accomplish.
2. Set AP Cost
	1. 1 AP: Basic, universally accessible actions
	2. 2 AP: Moderate effects, added risk or mobility
	3. 3+ AP: Powerful, disruptive, or situational actions
	4. Modifiers:
		1. +1 AP for movement or multi-target effects
		2. Keep within the 5 AP/round constraint for balance
3. Assign Difficulty Check (DC)
	1. Base on the intended complexity and impact:
		1. Moderate: DC 9–10 (reliable for Novice+)
		2. Advanced: DC 11–12 (reliable for Advanced)
		3. Complex: DC 13+ (ideal for Advanced or Master)
	2. Use the Difficulty Checks (DCs) and Success Rates table to align expected player capabilities with the action’s challenge.
4. Determine Effect and Degrees
	1. Tie the impact of the action to its AP cost and DC. High cost or high DC actions should have appropriately strong or dramatic effects.
		1. On Success: Main outcome
		2. Degrees of Success: Bonus effects
		3. Degrees of Failure: Complications or penalties
5. List Requirements, if any
	1. Specific equipment (e.g., a shield)
	2. An intended skill level
	3. A precondition (e.g., being adjacent, hidden, or readied)
6. Sanity Check – compare with existing actions to avoid redundancy or imbalance.
