# Inventory Management

In *Heroless*, carrying the right gear—and having it ready at the right time—can be the difference between survival and defeat. The inventory system balances realism with playability through two complementary systems:

- Item Slots represent gear that is immediately accessible.
- Pack Space abstracts bulk storage and consumable resources.

Together, these systems reflect both tactical readiness and long-term resource pressure.

## Item Slots
Each character begins with 5 Item Slots. These represent worn, equipped, or otherwise accessible items: weapons on a belt, armor worn, kits slung across a shoulder, etc.

Any item placed in a slot:

- Can be used without using the Retrieve action
- May still require an equip or preparation action, depending on context
- Can be handed to another character freely, during or outside of combat
- Remains reliably available unless lost or dropped in the narrative

### Items That Must Be Slotted
Some items are considered too large or critical to store in a pack. These items must be carried in an Item Slot to be used or transported:
- Weapons
- Armor
- Trade Goods / Loot

These items cannot be placed in your pack. They must be either slotted or dropped/stored elsewhere in the narrative world.

This limitation increases the value of Item Slots and forces meaningful choices about combat readiness versus resource management.

## Pack Space
Pack Space represents the abstract volume of stowed gear and consumables a character carries—rations, rope, torches, extra kits, and other general supplies.

- Starting Value: Characters begin with a Pack Space of 5
- Dynamic Use: This number increases as items are retrieved, representing diminishing organization and preparedness
- Restocking reduces your Pack Space, representing recovery and planning
- Equipment Retrieval: Using the Retrieve Action to find an item within your pack
	- Roll 2d6 + modifiers vs your current Pack Space value
	- Success – The item is located and retrieved, increase your Pack Space by 1
	- Failure – The item is lost, buried, used up or otherwise unavailable
- Items removed from your pack to a slot follow the same rules and check as retrieving any other stowed item.

### Automatic Retrieve Success
In situations where the character has ample time and freedom to search their pack, the GM may allow the Retrieve action to automatically succeed.

This is appropriate when the question is "Can it be found?", not "Do you still have it?"

However, in moments of uncertainty or tension—especially when supplies may be low—the GM may still call for a check to reflect resource depletion or disorganization, even if time is not a limiting factor.**
