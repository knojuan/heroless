# Combat

Combat in _Heroless_ is fast-paced, tactical, and driven by meaningful choices. Every moment counts, and every action matters. Players are empowered to shape the battlefield through a flexible Action Point (AP) system that supports both offense and defense, cooperation, and improvisation.

---

## Initiative

At the start of combat, each participant rolls for initiative using:

**2d6 + Agility**

Highest results act first. Initiative determines the order in which characters take their **turns**, but actions are not strictly limited to one's turn—thanks to the dynamic AP system.

Initiative is rolled once per encounter unless modified by an ability or effect.

## Action Points (AP)

Every character starts each round with **3 AP** by default.

- **AP fully refreshes** at the start of your turn.
    
- **Unused AP does not carry over** between rounds.
    
- **Temporary modifiers** (e.g., fatigue, traits, equipment) can raise or lower available AP.
    

### Spending AP

You may spend AP at **any time**, not just during your turn. This allows for reactive and cooperative tactics, like defending against an attack, aiding an ally, or seizing a sudden opportunity.

#### Examples of AP Use:

- **Movement** – repositioning, charging, retreating.
- **Attacks** – melee strikes, ranged shots, grapples.
- **Defensive Actions** – dodging, blocking, taking cover.
- **Support** – aiding an ally, coordinating tactics, using items.
See [Actions](09_actions.md) for a full list of available actions.

## Tactical Choices

Your turn is your opportunity to **act proactively**, but the AP system lets you **respond tactically** at any moment. You must decide how to split your limited AP:

- **Go all-in**: Spend all 3 AP on offense for a powerful flurry of attacks.
- **Hold back**: Use part of your AP for offense or movement, reserving AP to defend yourself or react later.
- **Coordinate**: Save AP to assist allies during their turns, enabling team synergy.

This system creates tension and depth: every AP you spend now is one you won’t have when it’s not your turn. Whether you strike hard, play defensively, or set up a combo with an ally, your choices shape the flow of battle.

## Flow of Combat Round
1. **Initiative is rolled** once at the start of combat (2d6 + Agility).
2. Combat proceeds in **initiative order**.
3. **At the start of your turn**, you refresh your full AP.
4. You may act during your turn and **spend AP at any time**, even outside it.
5. The cycle continues until the encounter ends.
